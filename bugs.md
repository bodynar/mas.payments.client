### Bugs

#### Payments

1. Open payments, go to page N. Open edit \ create form. Return back by crumbs. And opened page is 1, not N
2. [**DONE**] After create new payment - it must be added to list OR list must be reloaded again

#### All
1. [**DONE**] Create/edit card loads data from API. If error occurs - nothing rendered. Must be rendered error message or skeleton & make error human-readable

### To improve

#### All
1. [**DONE**] On cards with year-month selection - auto select current date
2. [**DONE**] After initial app load - gather notifications (user/notifications) and display it
3. [**DONE**] Add color pick for type
